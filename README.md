# mkblogs
mkblogs is a small little tool to serve blogs. It's mostly meant for my personal usage, but you can set it up with minimal effort too, simply because of how simple it is.

# usage
You can check `example` on how to setup a blog structure. Once you wish to host it, simply run `mkblogs serve <path/to/structure>` and it'll be hosted.
